# CSE440--Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Classical-Machine-Learning-Algorithms

## Work-flow

- There will be a dataset containing Bangla text
- We will run different classical ML models on the dataset to determine sentiment analysis
- We will evaluate their performance on sentiment classification tasks

## Google Colab File

- This is the collab file of our project: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1GtifTHqqhEtSBr4E_0I19CtDeD8MLuye

## How to run the Project 
- Download the drive folder from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GtifTHqqhEtSBr4E_0I19CtDeD8MLuye?usp=sharing
- Upload the folder in your Google Drive
- inside the folder, there is an ipynb file, open it in Google Colab
- run all the code blocks sequentially or just press `run all`
- the script will read the dataset from the Google Drive folder, so you might need to give permission for it
- models will run accordingly and then give you all the results block by block
- P.S. If you face any error, double-check the good drive path or let us know :D
